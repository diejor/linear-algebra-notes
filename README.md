# Linear Algebra Notes

My notes collected from a comprehensive study of Linear Algebra. Materials are covered from popular textbooks along with personal notes and homework solutions typed in the LaTex typesetting.

The purpose of the repository was to organize my work done through my MATH 2418 course taken at Univesity of Texas at Dallas first semester of my freshman year.

### Intro to Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang
- **6th Edition**
- **Notes** this is the textbook used by the department to teach LA.

### Linear Algebra Done Right
This textbook is an interesting approach to LA without introducing determinats in the spite of defining the theory in a more natural way.

### Homeworks

- Contains Jupyter Notebook and Python files for solutions to various homework assignments.
- Each homework folder may also contain additional resources, such as utility scripts or problem notes.
