# 📚 Linear Algebra Notes Repository

My notes collected studyingy Linear Algebra. Materials are covered from popular textbooks along with personal notes and homework solutions typed in the LaTex typesetting.
The purpose of the repository was to organize my work done through my MATH 2418 course taken at Univesity of Texas at Dallas first semester of my freshman year.

### Intro to Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang
- Notes: This is the textbook used by the department to teach Linear Algebra. I used 5th edition but the class used 6th.

### Linear Algebra Done Right
An interesting approach to Linear Algebra that avoids the introduction of determinants to define LA in a more natural way.
