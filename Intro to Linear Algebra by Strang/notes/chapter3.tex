\section{The Complete Solution to Ax = b}
The "easy" solution $x_p$ is when we take the free variables equal to $0$, where the $x_{pi}$ component is $0$ if it's at free column or equal to the $b_i$ component if it's at a pivot column. $x_p$ accounts for the particular solution to $Ax = b$ and the nullspace $x_n$ accounts for the general solution to $Ax = 0$. The complete solution is $x = x_p + x_n$.
