\begin{exercise}{7}
    $U = \{(a_1, a_2) \in R^2 : a_1, a_2 \in N\}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{8}
    Let $A = c(a_1, a_2), B = d(b_1, b_2)$, one example is $A \cup B$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{9}
     It is not subspace because it is true that for some $P = p_1*p_2$, then $(f + g)(x + P) = f(x + P) + g(x + P) = f(x) + g(x) = (f + g)(x)$. But only iff $p_1$ and $p_2$ are both rational numbers. The reason for that if not, then you can write some irrational number $p_1$ or $p_2$ as a rational which is a contradiction.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{10}
     clear
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{11}
    clear
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{12}
    We have that $u + w \in U \cup W$, then assume that $W \nsubseteq U$ and $U \nsubseteq W$, then $\exists u$ such that$u \in U$ and $u \notin W$. Similarly,  $\exists w$ such that $w \in W$ and $w \notin U$. Then $u + w \notin U \cup W$ which is a contradiction.
\end{exercise}
